# Debian-based Dev Container for Podman

This repository provides a reusable, high-performance development environment template for VS Code Dev Containers. It is built on Debian 12 (Bookworm) and optimized for use with Podman, while maintaining compatibility with Docker.

The core philosophy is to provide a clean, lightweight, and fast environment equipped with a suite of modern, productivity-enhancing CLI tools.

- **Base OS**: Debian 12 (Bookworm) Slim - A minimal and stable foundation.
- **Container Engine**: Optimized for Podman, the rootless, daemonless container engine.
- **Core Runtimes**: Comes with Git, Node.js (LTS), and Python 3.11 (via OS).
- **Modern CLI Arsenal**: A curated collection of fast and intuitive tools to supercharge your workflow.
- **Extensible**: Easily customize tools, VS Code extensions, and settings via the `.devcontainer/` directory.

2.  Give your new repository a name and description.
3.  Clone your newly created repository to your local machine.
4.  Open the cloned repository folder in Visual Studio Code.
5.  VS Code will automatically detect the `.devcontainer` configuration and ask if you want to "Reopen in Container". Click it to build and launch your new development environment.

### Option 2: For an Existing Project

Add this development environment to a project you're already working on.

1.  Copy the entire `.devcontainer` directory from this repository into the root of your existing project folder.
2.  Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3.  VS Code will detect the new `.devcontainer` configuration and prompt you to "Reopen in Container". Click it to get started.

## üîß Customization

- **Add more tools**: Edit the `RUN apt-get install` command in `.devcontainer/Containerfile`.
